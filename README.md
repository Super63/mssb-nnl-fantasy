Code to list out statistics for a Mario Superstar Baseball fantasy league based off of a Mario Superstar Baseball league called the National Netplay League (NNL)

Code takes an input of a .csv file that links each character to each user, along with what numbered character they are (for duplicate characters) and the division they are in

From a directory containing JSON statfiles of games played in the league, they will output a .csv file containing the statistics

NOTE: Code does not work unless both inputs are met, the .csv is posted here for a previous season (I believe season 6) but the statfiles are not here currently - code can work for other statfiles for different leagues if the .csv is changed accordingly along with the method 'renameTeam' to link each teams Project Rio name to their actual username wanted
